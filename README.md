An Air Canvas is an innovative computer vision application that allows users to "draw" in the air without any physical contact with a screen or paper. Instead, a camera (usually a webcam) captures the movement of a specific object, like a colored marker or a fingertip, and tracks its position to create lines or shapes on a virtual canvas displayed on the screen. This makes it possible to paint or write in mid-air, as the tracked object becomes a virtual brush.
